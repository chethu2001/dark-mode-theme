        const c = 300;

        // const a = 200;
        // console.log(a)//we will get syntax err because we cant reassign and redclare variables with the help of const keyword
        
        // c = 500; // here we will get type err because we cant reassign the value of the variable which is defined with the help of const kw
        // console.log(c);
        
        p = 800;
        var p;
        // console.log(p);//example for hoisting

        // v = 300;
        // let v;
        //console.log(v );// we will get err because let is not hoisted

        // const o;
        // o = 300;//wrong way to declare variable using const kw
        const l = 300;
        // console.log(o);//we will get syntax err
        console.log(l);//







        //1.var keyword
        //  var kw is used to support old browsers ,var has a global scope which means we can access the varibles defined with 
        // the var kw anywhere in the document 
        //1.var is gloabal scope kw
        //2.var is hoisted
        //3.declaration is possible
        //4.redclaratin is also possible
        //5.assigning is possible
        //6.reassigning is also possible
        //2.let keyword
        //let is a block scope and function scope variable we cannot access the variables which are defined the help of let kw out side the function and outside the block
        //1.let is not hoisted which means we cannot use the variables before the declaration but it was innitialized to the top not hoisted 
        //2.declaration is possible
        //3.redcalration is possible
        //4.assigning is possible
        //5.reassigning is not possible 
        //6.its a function scope and block scope variable 
        //3.const keyword
        //const is a function scope variable 
        //1.its not hoisted
        //2.declaration is possible 
        //3.redeclaration is not possible
        //4.assigning values is possible 
        //5.reassigning is not possible 
        //6.its a function scope and block scope variable
